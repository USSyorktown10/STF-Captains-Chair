Please open an issue if you find anything wrong with the game (There is a lot wrong with it)

- ### Game Stats
    - Current Version: `dev`
    - Sub Version: `dev6`
    - Bug Ammount: High
    - Non-Optimized Code: High
- ### How to Play
  - Choose between explore and drydock. I would start with drydock, because you dont have many `credits` yet. (Credits are the game currcency)
  - Start with the `Alpha Sector`, where the hostiles are easier, and there is more to mine.
  - I would NOT start a battle between a ship until you have upgraded your ship.
  - How to Get Credits and upgrade your ship
    - First, mine some materials. You may have to keep on exploring the alpha sector before you get it.
    - NOTE: Once you start mining, you cannot stop until the cluster is depleted.
    - Once you have the materials, explore until you find a trading post. Then, sell your materials.
    - After you sell your materials, return to drydock, and buy a `Phaser Upgrade` or `Max Health` upgrade.
    - Once you do that, you can start battling, and win more and more, and continually grow!
  - Note: There are many bugs in this game, and if you find one, please open an issue. Thanks and have fun!
